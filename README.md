# Bus-Pass-Booking-and-Management-System

The Bus Pass Booking Management Web Application automates and simplifies the process of handling bus pass requests and approvals, traditionally reliant on manual paperwork and in-person interactions. Users can submit their bus pass applications digitally, entering necessary details and uploading required documents directly through the platform. Submitted requests are automatically forwarded to the relevant administrator for review, expediting the approval process. Administrators can efficiently track and manage requests, ensuring timely reviews. Once a request is approved, users can make secure online payments, receiving real-time updates on their payment status. The application also sends notifications to keep users informed about their request progress, minimizing errors and improving record-keeping. Additionally, administrators can generate reports to monitor issued passes and analyze trends, ultimately providing a user-friendly and efficient system that enhances convenience for both users and administrators while reducing manual administrative tasks.
